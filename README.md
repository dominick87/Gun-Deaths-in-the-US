# Gun-Deaths-in-the-US

In this project, I'll explore a dataset containing information on gun deaths in the US from **2012** to **2014**, and try to find patterns in the demographics of the victims. 

The dataset comes from [FiveThirtyEight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/), and can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data).
